### 2. Data Science Translation

- Work with `HireDate` field (date conversions).

- Extract **year** from hire dates.

- Count hires per year.

- Plot hiring trend as a **line chart**.

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load dataset
hr_data = pd.read_excel(file_path, sheet_name="hr_dataset")

# Extract year from HireDate
hr_data['HireYear'] = hr_data['HireDate'].dt.year

# Count hires by year
hire_trend = hr_data.groupby('HireYear')['EmployeeID'].count().reset_index()

# Visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
plt.plot(hire_trend['HireYear'], hire_trend['EmployeeID'], marker='o', color="green")
plt.title("Hiring Trend Over the Years")
plt.xlabel("Year")
plt.ylabel("Number of Employees Hired")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

### 4. Business Output Explanation
